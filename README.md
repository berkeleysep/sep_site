# UC Berkeley SEP's Website
Welcome! You can view the progression of the SEP website here over the years.

See any bugs/things you'd like to fix? Raise an issue!

### Running locally
To run locally, clone this repo and then run:
```
npm install
npm start
```
which then runs `nodemon app/server.js`. You can also change this script in package.json. Then, go to localhost:4000 to view the homepage locally.

### Collaboration
Checkout a new branch before merging to master. That way you can collaborate on changes with others locally.

Pushing/merging to master triggers a deploy for the website automatically.

#### Organization
* All the html files are under /app as well as the server.js. 
* Everything else (css files, images, js files, templates) are under /public.
